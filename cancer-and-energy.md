Kurt Goldstein: "Life is a condition alternating between excitation, destruction
and unbalance, and reorganization, equilibrium and rest."

Oncological pathologists, looking at slices of a tumor, believe they can guess
when the cells have an evil intention. However, biologists studying living cells find that
cells can do only what they are allowed to do by their environment.

**Cancer: Disorder and Energy**
According to the World Health Organization, cancer is now the leading cause of death in
the world. Although many "causes" are known, and despite the "War on Cancer,"
nothing practical has been done to reduce the incidence of cancer. Since Nixon started
that war, the number of people dying annually in the US has increased faster than the
population. In ancient Rome and Egypt, cancer was rare; cancer has been identified in
only one Egyptian mummy. In the US and several other countries, between 2002 and
2005 there was an unprecedented decline (7% in the US) in the incidence of breast
cancer, when the medical use of estrogen decreased following the Women's Health
Initiative report showing that estrogen caused cancer, dementia, strokes and heart
attacks. However, when the public was reassured about estrogen's safety, breast
cancer incidence began increasing again each year.
The cancer industry has been flexible and imaginative in ways of presenting "age
standardized" death rates to show that they are making progress against cancer, but
there are philosophical and scientific problems in "oncology" (i.e., the study or treatment
of lumps) that should be considered by anyone who plans to do business with that
profession.
In the 19th century (in Johannes Muller's lab), cancers, like other animal tissues, were
found to be made up of cells, and by 1858, all diseases were said to be caused by
disturbances in cells (Rudolph Virchow). The atomic and molecular theory of matter was
becoming accepted at the time that animals were found to be made up of cells, and in
both cases the "elementary particles" seemed to have a special power to explain things.
This idea of a cellular basis of disease gradually displaced the old idea that diseases
were caused by an imbalance of the body fluids, or humors. In 1863, Virchow
recognized that inflammation, involving leukocytes, was a common feature of cancer,
but that aspect of his work was neglected for a long time.
Recent medical textbooks reveal no major change in the understanding of cancer since
Virchow's time, except that "genes" (which weren't known during Virchow's life)
gradually became the most important aspect of cells. The typical modern textbook
describes the cellular disturbance of cancer as the result of an "initiating" mutation in a
gene, which gives it the potential to develop into a cancer, if it subsequently is exposed
to a "promoter," which causes it to multiply. In some versions of the theory, a promoter is
a second mutation that causes proliferation, but in other versions the promotion is
caused by chemicals binding to receptors the way hormones do, to stimulate
proliferation. Typically, textbooks (and reports of continuing research) describe
subsequent changes in the genes that cause a cancer to progress from a simple excess
of cells through stages of increasing malignancy: hyperplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma in
situ, invasive cancer.
One of the reasons that the medical understanding of cancer hasn't changed
significantly since Virchow's time is that blaming misbehaving cells for causing a tumor
fits into the older medical tradition, that has existed at least since the time of
Hippocrates, 400 BC, which treated tumors either by cutting them out, or by burning
them off with caustics. Virchow's identification of misbehaving cells provided a clear
mental image of exactly what the physician must try to destroy. And it's probably hard to
get interested in something which could seriously limit your professional activities if it
turned out to be true.
The "cellular basis of cancer" was developed simultaneously with the germ theory of
disease, and in the case of cancer, the deviant cells came to be considered an alien
substance, "not-self," analogous to infective germs. Paul Ehrlich's search for poisons
that were specific for bacterial pathogens was quickly extended to the idea of finding
poisons that would distinguish between cancer cells and the patient's cells.
Hippocrates' therapeutic approach to cancer may have survived for 2400 years, but the
ideas of his younger contemporary, Plato, about order and causation have probably had
a greater effect on medicine. Plato believed that the world of experience is inferior and
accidental, and that there are timeless "Forms" that are the real substances. In the
atomic theory of matter, eternal, unchanging atoms took the place of platonic forms, and
there are still molecular biologists who insist that life can only be explained in terms of
its constituent atoms ("What else is there but atoms?"). This philosophy of timeless
forms was a deep commitment of people like Gregor Mendel and August Weismann,
whose ideas dominated the thinking of early 20th century geneticists. Genes were the
immutable essence of organisms, and the cells, tissues, and organs that form the
organism are merely temporal and accidental. Weismann's "germ plasm" or germ line
contained the immortal genes, the rest of the body lacked them, and was essentially
mortal.
For most of the 20th century, the official doctrine was that most of the cells of the adult
body became stationary once the body reached its adult size, and that aging consisted
of the "wearing out" of those mortal cells. When a tumor, containing new cells, would
appear and grow, these cells were called "immortal," because they didn't follow the rule
for normal, stationary, mortal cells. Their "immortality" is often demonstrated by growing
them endlessly in culture dishes. Normal cells, if they can be made to survive in a
culture dish, are likely to be "transformed" into cancer, demonstrated by their ability to
replicate in dishes.
